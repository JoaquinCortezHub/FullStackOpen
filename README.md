# FullStackOpen
Repo with all the @FullStackOpen 's course exercises to learn fullstack development.
## Objective üéØ
- The objective with this course is to learn and even master the MERN stack for
  fullstack development. I'm interested in learning and being proficient in the
  React framework to later integrate it with a Django (Python) backend and a
  RESTful API.
- I'm also interested in learning to work with MongoDB and also being able to
  integrate it with my Django knowledge.

  In general, I want to have a broader experience working with fullstack applications
  and being able to cover all areas of the web development process.
## Expectations üß†
- I expect this course to teach me how to comfortably navigate through both the front and 
  the backend of an application. I'm also excited to learn about debugging and I'm curious 
  to learn about native applications which is something totally foreign to me.
- I also expect to complete this course before the end of 2023, before starting college,
  allowing me to be better prepared for a most likely rough first year.
